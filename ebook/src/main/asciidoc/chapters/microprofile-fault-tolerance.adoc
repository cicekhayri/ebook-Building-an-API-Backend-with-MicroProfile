== MicroProfile Fault Tolerance

With MicroProfile Fault Tolerance, we can build services which will work even when something failed.
`@Timeout` annotation is used to avoid waiting forever for the response.

[source, java]
----
@Timeout(0)
@GET
public Response getAll() {
    return Response.ok(bookService.getAll()).build();
}
----

`@Fallbac` annotation is used when something went wrong with the call then it will still operate without throwing an exception.

[source, java]
----
@Timeout(0)
@Fallback(fallbackMethod = "getAllFallbackMethod")
@GET
public Response getAll() {
    return Response.ok(bookService.getAll()).build();
}

public Response getAllFallbackMethod() {
    return Response.ok(Stream.of("Book One", "Book Two").collect(toList())).build();
}
----

`@Retry` annotation is used to repeat the call when something failed.

[source, java]
----
@Retry(maxRetries = 3, delay = 300)
@GET
public Response getAll() {
    return Response.ok(bookService.getAll()).build();
}
----

With `@Bulkhead` annotation you can limit the number of concurrent request that are made to the method

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Bulkhead(10)
public Response getAll() {
    return Response.ok(bookService.getAll()).build();
}
----

`@CircuitBreaker` annotation is used to immediately interrupt the call if the called services previously failed.

[source, java]
----
@GET
@CircuitBreaker(delay = 2000, requestVolumeThreshold = 2, failureRatio=0.65, successThreshold = 3)
public Response getAll() {
    return Response.ok(bookService.getAll()).build();
}
----
