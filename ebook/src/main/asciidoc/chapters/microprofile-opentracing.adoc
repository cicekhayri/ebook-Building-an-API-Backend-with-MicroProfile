= MicroProfile OpenTracing

OpenTracing is a standardized API that allows developers to instrument their own services for distributed tracing.
With distributed tracing, you can troubleshoot your services by logging the requests.


`@Traced` annotation specify a class or method to be traced and has two arguments, which are optional.

We can use tracing tools like Zipkin or Jaeger to monitor and troubleshoot latency problems in distributed systems.
