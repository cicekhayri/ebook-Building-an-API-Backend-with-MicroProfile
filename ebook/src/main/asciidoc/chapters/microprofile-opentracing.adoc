== MicroProfile OpenTracing

OpenTracing is a standardized API that allows developers to instrument their own services for distributed tracing.
With distributed tracing, you can troubleshoot your services by logging the requests.


`@Traced` annotation specify a class or method to be traced and has two arguments, which are optional.

@Traced(operationName = "booksOperation")
public Response books() throws MalformedURLException {

We can use tracing tools like Zipkin or Jaeger to monitor and troubleshoot latency problems in distributed systems.
